## Stack:

```README
A "stack" is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc. A real-world stack allows operations at one end only.
It has one ended operation defined on it and follows LIFO structure (Last In First Out).
```

### Types of Expression:

1. Infix Expression: `The operator is in between the two operands.`<br/>
   Example: A + B is known as infix expression.

2. Postfix Expression: `The operator is after the two operands.`<br/>
   Example: BD + is known as postfix expression.

3. Prefix Expression: `The operator is before the two operands.`<br/>
   Example: + BD is known as prefix expression.
